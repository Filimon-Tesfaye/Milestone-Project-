      <h1>A Short History of HTTP</h1>
      <p>
        The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was originally created in the early 1990s
        at CERN as part of Tim Berners‑Lee’s work on the World Wide Web. The goal was
        simple: define a lightweight protocol that allowed a client (a web browser)
        to request hypertext documents from a server.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Web and HTTP/0.9</h2>
      <p>
        The first documented version of HTTP is sometimes called HTTP/0.9. It was
        extremely simple and supported only one method: <code>GET</code>. Requests
        did not include headers, and servers responded with just the raw HTML body.
        There was no concept of status codes or content negotiation.
      </p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table>
          <caption>Early HTTP Milestones</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Year (approx.)</th>
              <th>Milestone</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>1990–1991</td>
              <td>Prototype HTTP and first web server</td>
              <td>Used at CERN to share research documents.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1993</td>
              <td>HTTP/0.9 widely used</td>
              <td>Simple text‑based protocol, only <code>GET</code>.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1996</td>
              <td>HTTP/1.0 described in RFC 1945</td>
              <td>Introduced headers, status codes, and more methods.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1997</td>
              <td>HTTP/1.1 published in RFC 2068 (later 2616)</td>
              <td>Became the dominant version of HTTP for many years.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Standardization Through RFCs</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, HTTP was standardized through a series of Request for Comments (RFCs).
        HTTP/1.0 was documented in RFC&nbsp;1945, and HTTP/1.1 was later refined and
        clarified in a set of specifications that replaced the original single RFC.
        These documents defined the request–response model that browsers and servers
        still use today.
      </p>

      <h2>From Simple Documents to a Full Web Platform</h2>
      <p>
        As the web grew from static documents to complex applications, HTTP had to
        support new use cases: image loading, forms, cookies, caching, streaming,
        and APIs. This growth eventually motivated new protocol versions
        (HTTP/2 and HTTP/3) that focused on performance and reliability on modern
        networks. Those versions are discussed in more detail on the
        <a href="topic2.html">HTTP Evolution</a> page.
